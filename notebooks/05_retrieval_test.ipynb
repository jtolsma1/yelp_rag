We went in a party of four, and ordered 5 dishes and got to tried all of fhem:) Prosciutto, ricotta & honey toast Savory crepe Banana nutella crepe Coconut stuffed pineapple french toast Omelette They are all pretty good I like the toast best -- mainly because the serving size is reasonable and it's not too buttery or sweet like the other one The interior is bright and clean with a high ceiling! Service is great, our server was very attentive!  \n",

I get you're doing your job but you're working in an area that caters to people coming from out of town. If this is how you act towards everyone then it's on you. You have an app system that tells people that tables are ready and we come and you give attitude  \n",
