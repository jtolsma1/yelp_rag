The table behind us also had issues with the service, and ended up getting part of their meal comped due to the lack of delivery by the staff. Disappointed in the staff and management for the experience we had last night in the bar room at Cheddar's.  \n",

It's divey (ish) with good bar food. Given all of the options nearby, I would definitely choose this over any of them. I also got a $4 glass of decent wine. Oh, and you can smoke inside.
