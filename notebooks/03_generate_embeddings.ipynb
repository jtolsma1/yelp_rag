       "      <td>This was our third visit to French Toast. We put our names on the waiting list earlier today and when we were notified it was our time we were right on time. They then told us to sit at the bar or at the table closest to the restroom, we shared we had been on the wait list for hours and wanted to be seated at the booth. They were indifferent and told us those were are options. This was interesting because then other 2 person parties were seated in the booth. The servers are beyond busy which I understand but we didn't get asked for our order for over 25 minutes and it was a task to get anyone's attention. Food wasn't as good as the first time we came, my boyfriend's French toast didn't have syrup and we had to ask three separate people for it. By the time the one person remembered to give it to us, his food was cold. The staff were pretty rude and we had a really terrible experience this time. I wanted to speak with a manager before we left but it was so hectic and took us forever to e</td>\n",

It was the best breakfast I had on our whole trip. I got the salmon toast with an over hard egg. The fried chicken and waffles looked delicious but too heavy for us because we were flying out that morning. The bread is fluffy and fresh. I also got a latte which was amazing!! I'm pretty sure everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong. Staff was friendly as well! This would definitely be a place I would go back to when I visit Again in the future   \n",

I had the bacon, onion, and gruyere crepe, while the other in my party had the traditional French toast. We also had an order of the aebleskivers with the lemon curd and jam dipping sauces. The portions for the prices were huge! We were not expecting so much food. The crepe was savory and loaded with bacon and creamy gruyere. The French toast was just sweet enough without being overbearing and was not soggy or cakey like most other breakfast restaurants. Next time, we will definitely try the King Cake French Toast!   \n",

I ordered chicken and waffles with a cayenne pepper butter and syrup. Talk about good eating! My friends ordered the king cake French toast (It was super sweet but tasty) and the spinach crepes with a side salad. Everything was good from service to food. The sodas weren't really strong but that's okay; apparently they also had good sweet tea as well my friend ordered that. Even though we arrived 30 minutes before closing time our service was as if we were the first to order upon opening; I really liked that, we didn't feel rushed. So will I return? Of course!   \n",

       "283  This was our third visit to French Toast. We put our names on the waiting list earlier today and when we were notified it was our time we were right on time. They then told us to sit at the bar or at the table closest to the restroom, we shared we had been on the wait list for hours and wanted to be seated at the booth. They were indifferent and told us those were are options. This was interesting because then other 2 person parties were seated in the booth. The servers are beyond busy which I understand but we didn't get asked for our order for over 25 minutes and it was a task to get anyone's attention. Food wasn't as good as the first time we came, my boyfriend's French toast didn't have syrup and we had to ask three separate people for it. By the time the one person remembered to give it to us, his food was cold. The staff were pretty rude and we had a really terrible experience this time. I wanted to speak with a manager before we left but it was so hectic and took us forever to e   \n",
