# Index Artifacts (`indexes/`)

This directory contains generated artifacts produced by the RAG pipeline.  
These files are not source code and are **not meant to be edited manually**.

They can be safely deleted and rebuilt at any time by rerunning the pipeline.

### What Lives Here

Folder contents are comprised of:

- `*.faiss`  
  FAISS vector indices used for semantic similarity search.  
  In this project, indices are generally built **per restaurant** to enable
  fast, scoped retrieval.

- `*_meta.parquet`  
  Metadata tables associated with each FAISS index.  
  These map vector positions back to:
  - restaurant names & IDs
  - review IDs
  - chunk text
  - similarity scores
  - other relevant metadata (stars, dates, etc.)

File names are currently keyed by `restaurant_id` so that indices and metadata
can be paired deterministically.

### How These Files Are Created

These artifacts are generated by the pipeline during the embedding (`embedding.py`) step.

They are written automatically by the code in `src/` and should not be created
or modified by hand.

---

### Version Control Policy

- These files are excluded from git
- They are considered derived data
- If something looks wrong, the correct fix is to:
  1. delete the affected files
  2. rerun the pipeline

### When to Delete This Directory

It is safe (and sometimes useful) to, apart from this README.md, delete the entire contents of `indexes/` if:

- the embedding model changes
- any chunking parameters change
- retrieval logic changes
- any other pipeline code has been rebuilt or refactored

The pipeline will recreate all required files.
